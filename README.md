# End to end Fraud-Detection Study Project

## Workflows

1. Update config.yaml
2. Update params.yaml
3. Update entity
4. Update the configuration manager in src config
5. update the conponents
6. update the pipeline
7. update the main.py
8. update the app.py

## Aim

To create a project with the following features:

1. Accepts data in any file format
2. Handles missing values and imbalanced target field dataset
3. Assess which model would give the best predictions on the given dataset
4. Can implement any of the Classification Algorithm on the cleaned dataset
5. Has GitHub Actions and AWS deployment for CI/CD
6. Can retrain the model if more data is provided
7. Can accept single record or a file of records for predictions
8. Returns the predictions in a csv file

### (Further Improvements)
1. Can update the model if there is a shift in the distribution of the dataset
2. App Improvements
3. DVC
4. Automation of the Workflow
5. Ability to do prediction on more than one dataset/pipeline simultaneously
